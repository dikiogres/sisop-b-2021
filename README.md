# Instant Messaging App
- Messages are exchanged as Java objects, so you HAVE TO use object serialisation.
- Users can log in to the system BEFORE they can send messages. Users only need to enter a username. Passwords are not needed.
- Users can see other online users. It can be either in real-time or by request from the client app. (Salah satu boleh)
- Users can send private messages to other users.
- Users can send broadcast messages to all online users, including themselves.
- The communication is encrypted using SSL (optional). If you would like to implement this one, several steps are needed to set up the server-side application.
